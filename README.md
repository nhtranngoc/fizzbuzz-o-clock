## But Nam, isn't this overkill?

This project is the coding equivalent of my grandma using her family heirloom cleaver to chop a single sardine. So, yes. But the purpose of this exercise is to learn Angular by building a small toy project. At some point in the future I will probably add a `lite` version with a single `index.html`. Alas, but that is not today. 

## HexClock Allegations
Please check out https://www.jacopocolo.com/hexclock/ for the original design. I only want to spend an hour on this and shamelessly stole his layout. Please forgive me as I am only human.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
